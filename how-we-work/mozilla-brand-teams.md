# Workflow Overview

*We follow the process outlined in the Agile Playbook. The process starts with defining OKRs for each quarter (TL). We then meet to have a quarterly planning session (whole team) when the team needs to understand the OKRs and generate high level (one sentence) ideas, which will serve as backlog for the quarter ahead. This is usually a post-it and whiteboard/flip-chart session. All of the ideas are being transferred to a Trello board which becomes our product backlog for the rest of the quarter.*

*We plan each sprint by first looking at our KR status tracker, to see where we are in terms of achieving our goals and KRs, and then we look at the Trello board to choose ideas that will help us achieve our goals and key results.*

*Next, ideas are broken down to user stories and tasks by the team and noted in WiP spreadsheet. Team members (story leads) define acceptance criteria, dependencies and size the user story in 'ideal time' (S- M - L = 1 - 3 - 5 points).*

*Lastly we have a working session to read through and discuss to make sure the sprint backlog is clear and stories meets our criteria. Criteria here are: user story is understood and small enough to fit into a sprint. A story needs to be broken down into several tasks (usually task is 1 day of work). The number of tasks depend on the size of the user story. The read through also gives an idea of how much work there will be in the upcoming sprint and allows the team to decide if the scope  is achievable. Story leads can also advocate to elevate a story higher on the priority list.*

*This ends with the PM and TL assigning priorities to the list and deciding what will make the board and what stays in the backlog. PM then creates the board in Taiga and sends an email to the team.*

*Sprint consists of several meetings, i.e. stand-ups, sprint-projects specific meetings, weekly syncs with other teams, KR status review, concepting meetings.*

*Sprint ends with Retro and Demo Planning which are then followed by a Demo presentation. *

## Work Intake

*Backlog is generated in the quarterly planning sessions and then is developed further through:*
* *Weekly concepting meetings result in new ideas being added to the backlog*
* *KR status review*
* *TL with PM adding new items*
* *Other teams bring ideas to us*

## Approval Process

*Once work is proposed how is it evaluated, what happens if it is approved what if it is put on hold?*
*Work that comes in is evaluated first by TL and PM and then added to the backlog with the right priority. In most cases it's also reviewed by the team (Slack, Concepting meetings)*
*Work that goes on hold, goes back to the backlog.*

## Backlog

*Trello cards, sorted by KR. Usually one sentence ideas. But also fully fleshed user stories in WiP - depends on far did the idea get in a planning meeting, or if it was placed back in the backlog. We do not use Taiga for managing backlog.*

## Board Details

* *What are your columns, what do the columns mean.*
* *A column is New, In progress, Ready for Test and Done, which mean: not started, being worked on, in review with the stakeholder/s or TL, closed/done.*
* *How/when to cards move across the board*
* *In ideal world I like one card to move once per day, but multiple (2-3) cards can move per day too, especially if these are in review stages.*
* *What does done mean*
* *Approved by "A" person*

## Daily Standups

*How / when to stand ups occur, what happens during a meeting, be brief!*
*Vidyo with PM sharing the Taiga board on the screen, 15 min Mon-Thu / daily except Friday's, we go top to bottom (order of priority) and ask for update (day's focus), impediments and if support from the team is needed.*

## Retrospectives

*How does the team do Retrospectives.Again.. be brief!*
*Shout outs, what was done right, what needs to be done better, eveluate experiments we tried and talk about new experiments we want to try next sprint/s*
