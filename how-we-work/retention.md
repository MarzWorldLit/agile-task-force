# Workflow Overview

* *We follow the basics of the agile version that marketing set up: we have a product backlog in a spreadsheet (tied to our OKRs), there are a lot of stories in the backlog that may or may not be prioritized based on whether it is tied to an OKR or a something that we want to do. We try to limit what is on the taiga baord for a sprint.*
* *We do not use points or burn down charts.*
* *we do not set due dates on things since we work in sprint, the expectation is, if we committed to getting a certain amount of work done in a sprint, then that's when it's due.*
* *Everyone swarms the top priority story and then on down*

## Work Intake

* *most of our work comes from OKRs*
* *sometimes other teams like Acquisition or Creators come to us with support requests, like an email.* 

## Approval Process

* *We assess requests based on audience, goal for support and our priorities, usually with a good conversation with the requester we can suss out what is appropriate and should be prioritized for an upcoming sprint*
* *Ususally our support of other teams is not specifically time based like a new feature for firefox, but sometimes it is, if there is a request for a snippet on PI day*
* *We prioritize our own work for our OKRs in our sprint planning, there are usually dependencies that are apart of that discussion. A lot of our work if affected by or affects different orgs in Mozilla*

## Backlog
* *1st Column - OKRs*
* *2nd Column - Epics*
* *3rd Column - User or Internal story*
* *4th Column - Status (what state is it in in the backlog) New, WIP, Hold, Added to Upcoming sprint...*
* *5th Column  - Priority (what is the priority for the quarter (done this quarter, this sprint, next sprint)*
* *6th Column - Acceptance criteria for User Story, Value for Internal Story (why are we using resources on this interal story, what is the outcome)*
* *7th Column - Tasks*
* *8th Column - Size of story S,M,L (S=1-2 days, M=1 week (5), L=whole sprint (5.5+)*
* *9th Column - Dependencies (may affect the story from being prioritized or put on hold)*
* *10th Column - Related Docs*


## Board Details

* *User Story, New (new task, hasn't been started yet), In Progress (work has started), Review (Michele signs off that it's done, or if other people need to review the work, like design), Done, Archive info (in case something has changed and we just don't want to delete the card, there may be relevant info inside the card)*
* *The team moves the cards and adds more info inside of them and any relevant docs*
* *What does done mean? For a task, Michele has sign off on it or we know it's done cuz it was simple. For a user story, it's done when the AC is met, and for an internal story, when the value has been reached so we can move forward to the next steps*


## Daily Standups

*4 fifteen minute stand ups, we walk through each story starting at the top, we also have 2 extended stand ups where we can discuss questions, concerns and get clarity on stories.*

## Retrospectives

* *We meet the day after the sprint ends, and we go through the usual questions, what went well, what can we do better, what do we want to try in the upcoming sprint.*
* *I created a backlog for our retros, and we prioritize what we want to try in the upcoming sprint.*
* *I add those pieces to the Taiga board for the sprint, to remind us of the behavior or actions we are trying out*
