# Mozilla.org Durable Team Workflow Overview

Generally how things work for the Mozilla.org Durable Team (we are, primarily, a service organization)

For more detail into our processes, the Mozilla.org Workflow can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4PLfoEZW8OVoBT1ZBVu4NOOz6WUeqySpnWaeNrAVTQ/edit#slide=id.g2b28aa21b3_2_585)

## Work Intake

*How work comes to the team and where does it go to get triaged*

Work requests come in to the mozilla.org durable team from both durable and functional teams from across MoCo & MoFo.
   
   * The intake funnels are:
      * Via Durable Teams
         * Work requests entered into one of the 3 teams, Firefox Growth; Mozilla (Consumers/Creators); Firefox Retention, prioritization lists that result in either Tier 1 briefs (complex work requests) or bugs (simple work requests)
      * Via any other team or group in MoCo or MoFo who will, after initial consult with the Team Lead and/or PM, submit a Tier 1 brief or a bug
   * Triage 
      * Briefs - are submitted to David Tenser for SLT level approval. When briefs are approved they then come to the team for in depth review in a kickoff meeting with the requesting team
      * Bugs - These are reviewed by one or more of the moz.org team members depend on the nature of the bug. Currently the PM (Eric Renaud) has a weekly meeting for [Bug Triage](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=run&namedcmd=mozilla.org%20needs%20triage&sharer_id=148348&list_id=14026853) with another team member that/who revolves on a monthly basis.
   * Prioritization
      * Work is prioritized according to the model [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MnxtGiPuYZ1KxFY-KM-NQh7VFlaysJp7gB4rBkJyFXo/edit)
      
*How does mozilla.org decide which work to do first?*
   
   * First comes first, from each bucket. The top priority item in each bucket gets pulled first based on factors of:
      * Readiness - while the work request may be #1, it may not yet, e.g., have an approved brief, so we can't work on it yet
      * Deadline - there's a hard delivery date we can't miss so work request 'x' from team 'y' has to go in front
      * Resource allocation & bottlenecks - we're full up for the moment, but when the bottleneck clears, you're next!
Our team has the capacity to work on multiple requests simultaneously. So, there can be more than just one number one.

## Approval Process

*Once work is proposed how is it evaluated, what happens if it is approved what if it is put on hold?*

This depends on the type of work (which bucket and the Accountable person identified in the RASCI)

Simple work requests are evaluated by the PM and an appropriate team member based on the ask (requirements) and the work is entered to the Ready column to be pulled in when a card (another work request) is Done and the appropriate resources available to pick up the work.

Complex work (brief required), once approved by SLTs, comes to the team and is distributed for review in advance of the kickoff meeting that occurs to initiate the project.

When the Team Lead approves the work at hand it is then reviewed by the Accountable/Approver identified in the RASCI for approval.  When approval is given the team finalizes the work and takes it live asap or on the specified delivery date.

## Backlog

The mozilla.org [backlog](https://tree.taiga.io/project/malexis-mozillaorg-durable-team/backlog) is populated in Taiga and identified in the Kanban board as 'Incoming'.

## Board Details

* What are your columns, what do the columns mean?

Board columns:  Incoming | Research | Ready | In progress | Review | Done | Archived 

* How/when to cards move across the board?

Cards are moved by any member of the team when a change in status is indentified. Chiefly this falls to the Program Manager, then to the individuals owning a card at the given moment until such time the state changes and it needs to move to another people resource and/or to another column.

* What does done mean?

Done means a fully approved (Accountable/Approver) work item is complete according to the established Acceptance Criteria. Most commonly, but not exclusively, this means the results of the body of work are live on mozilla.org or blog.mozilla.org.


## Daily Standups

*How / when to stand ups occur, what happens during a meeting, be brief!*

* Stand up & Status - Mondays at 9-9:30 am PT - Stand up followed by project status review 
* Stand ups - Tuesdays & Thursdays at 9-9:15 am PT
* Team time - Wednesdays at 9-10 am PT - recurring, non-required meeting where we attempt realize the benefits of colocation (as we are not colocated)


## Retrospectives

Team Retrospectives are held every three weeks. These are 'team only' meetings, defined as safe spaces in which candid commentary is allowed and expected with the intent learn from previous circumstances
We focus on: 
* What worked well
* What didn't work well
* What can be improved/what new things can we do
